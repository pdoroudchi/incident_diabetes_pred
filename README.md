# Incident Diabetes Prediction with Python

In this personal project I:

- Created custom uniform imputation function to treat large sparse biomarker dataset with NumPy and pandas
- Applied log-transform, standardization, and PCA feature engineering to optimize skewness & dimension of data
- Ran weighted logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost (89% accuracy) to handle class imbalance with scikit-learn
