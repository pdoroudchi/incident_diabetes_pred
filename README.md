# Incident Diabetes Prediction with Python

In this personal project I:

- Leveraged clinical biomarker and demographic data to predict incident diabetes in a public health cohort
- Filtered and cleaned data with pandas, removing leakage-prone features to improve model integrity
- Developed a custom imputation function to handle large, sparse biomarker data with NumPy and pandas
- Conducted feature engineering (log-transform, standardization, PCA) to optimize model performance
- Trained weighted logistic regression, SVM, & XGBoost (89% accuracy) to handle class imbalance with sklearn

\* Due to large dataset file size, I am unable to upload the dataset to GitHub. Please shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:pdoroudchi@gmail.com">pdoroudchi@gmail.com</a> and I will happily send over the dataset.
