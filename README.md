# Incident Diabetes Prediction with Python

In this personal project I:

- Developed a custom imputation function to handle large, sparse biomarker data with NumPy and pandas
- Applied feature engineering (log-transform, standardization, PCA) to optimize model accuracy & dimensionality
- Ran weighted logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost (89% accuracy) to handle class imbalance with scikit-learn

\* Due to large dataset file size, I am unable to upload the dataset to GitHub. Please shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:pdoroudchi@gmail.com">pdoroudchi@gmail.com</a> and I will happily send over the dataset.
